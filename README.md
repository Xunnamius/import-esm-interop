# import-esm-interop

> [WTF is this?!][3] ... ... Well, this package is kinda useless until [said
> issue][3] is resolved.

This package exposes a tiny Node.js-only wrapper around the `import` function.
This purpose of this wrapper is as syntactic sugar for dynamic imports of
[**externalized ESM dependencies**][webpack-node-externals] in TypeScript/ESM
source destined to be bundled as CJS by Webpack. Since this package should
itself be an [externalized dependency][webpack-node-externals], using
`import-esm-interop` ensures:

- Webpack does not convert the dynamic import into a require statement
- Webpack does not [complain about "critical dependencies"][1] that have been
  properly externalized
- Webpack does not do something catastrophic like [blindly bundle _all your
  source files_ into one massive chunk][2]

Hence, this package has a very niche use case and **you probably don't need
it**. For most packages, it's easier to use their CJS entry point if available.
In a decade (ü§ûüèø) when CJS is dead and buried and ESM reigns supreme, this
package will be deprecated.

This package also passes through TypeScript typings if provided.

## Install

```Shell
npm install import-esm-interop
```

## Usage

> This interop function should only be used in CJS code or code that is compiled
> down to CJS (such as TypeScript)!

```TypeScript
const { importEsm } = require('import-esm-interop');

// Equivalent to (await import('some-lib')).default
const someLib = await importEsm('some-lib');

// Equivalent to the above
const someLib = await importEsm('some-lib', 'default');

// Equivalent to the above, but with TypeScript typings
const someLib = await importEsm<import('some-lib').default>('some-lib');

// Equivalent to (await import('some-lib')).aNamedExport
const aNamedExport = await importEsm('some-lib', 'aNamedExport');

// Equivalent to { bNamedExport: (...).bNamedExport, cNamedExport: ... }
const { bNamedExport, cNamedExport } = await importEsm(
  'some-lib',
  'bNamedExport',
  'cNamedExport'
);

// Equivalent to the above, but with TypeScript typings
const { bNamedExport, cNamedExport } = await importEsm<{
  bNamedExport: import('some-lib').bNamedExport,
  cNamedExport: import('some-lib').cNamedExport
}>('some-lib', 'bNamedExport', 'cNamedExport');

// Equivalent to await import('some-lib')
const SomeLib = await importEsm('some-lib', '*');

// Equivalent to the above, but with TypeScript typings
const SomeLib = await importEsm<import('some-lib')>('some-lib', '*');
```

If reusing the same typed import multiple times, you can make things less
painful by extracting away the dynamic import into a top-level function. Said
function could even be placed in a shared util file somewhere.

For example:

```TypeScript
// file: ./vendor-interop.ts

export const importSomeLib = async () => {
  return importEsm('some-lib', 'bNamedExport', 'cNamedExport') as {
    bNamedExport: import('some-lib').bNamedExport,
    cNamedExport: import('some-lib').cNamedExport
  };
}

// file: ./index.ts

import { importSomeLib } from './vendor-interop'

export async function doesSomething() {
  const { bNamedExport } = await importSomeLib();
  bNamedExport();
}
```

Again, we use `importEsm` instead of inlining the dynamic import to avoid
problems with Webpack. If you're not bundling your source, then there is **no
need** to use this sugar function!

## Documentation

> Further documentation can be found under [`docs/`][docs].

This is a [CJS2 package][cjs-rum-and-coke] built for Node14 and above. Due to it
being for CJS<->ESM interop, **this package is only available via `require(...)`
and cannot be imported by ESM code!** Further, this package is not meant to be
bundled (and will likely cause an error if it is attempted), and should instead
be [externalized][webpack-node-externals] along with every other module under
`node_modules/`.

For TypeScript and IDEs, each entry point (i.e. `ENTRY`) in [`package.json`'s
`exports[ENTRY]`][package-json] object includes an
[`exports[ENTRY].types`][exports-types-key] key pointing to its respective
TypeScript declarations file. There may be [other keys][package-json] for [other
runtimes][exports-conditions] as well, including `node` and `browser`. Finally,
[`package.json`][package-json] also includes the
[`sideEffects`][side-effects-key] key, which I set to `false` by default for
most of my libraries.
